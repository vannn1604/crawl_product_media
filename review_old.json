Durability-wise, i've dropped mine several times, even on parquet and carpeted concrete - and it still works. However, downsides are file sharing - next to impossible, as no USB, no IR, no bluetooth. so it's impossible to add to the games/tones, unless you use the composer feature. Also, texting can be difficult due to the VERY small size of the keys, and keypad sensitivity can be beaten by older phones, so no 'no-look' or speedtexting, as you can't rely on the number of keypresses actually registering. As previously mentioned, battery life is approx 2 - 3 days on standby mode. Finally, contrary to specs listed here, no stopwatch and no video capacity.

After only 1 week of use [if you could call it use] I dumped the acer OS [shell] and installed SPD shell this livened the phone up a bit but it still freezes often may be due to winMo 6.1 ?? also found that when battery gets to 70% charge performance really drops off the price is very good but that's not really a reason for buying as you would be better paying a few pounds more and not being frustrated with your purchase. Battery life poor this is a charge every night machine if you want to use any features the GPS was a good feature and google maps. call quality I found to be poor over all the lack of RAM makes general use a pain as you have to constantly lear apps from RAM to enhance performance however I think this is partly a WinMo problem only enhanced by the poor spec  DON'T BUY", "rating": "0", "location": "mxB"}, {"username": "JZ", "time": "06 Jan 2010", "content": "the 3G information for this phone appears to be wrong?", "rating": "0", "location": "N$s"}, {"username": "ACER", "time": "28 Dec 2009", "content": "it is good phones", "rating": "0", "location": "vG0"}, {"username": "saha", "time": "18 Dec 2009", "content": "this is a good phones", "rating": "0", "location": "vG4"}, {"username": "raghad", "time": "29 Nov 2009", "content": "it's good for men but it's so slow and the sound is bad.", "rating": "0", "location": "Tr0"}, {"username": "nick", "time": "26 Nov 2009", "content": "software problems already.

I wish I could join you. As an early adopter I paid \u00a3380, probably twice as much as many of you did but I have just retired this expensive brick. Where do I begin? From Day One, it kept switching off by itself, until I found it needed a firmware upgrade, thanks to the forums and no thanks to Acer. That's sorted, but now, the on-off button turns it off but cannot turn it back on. To restart, I have to remove and replace battery! Battery life is woeful - after 6-7 hours (less than normal working day) it needs charging, so I keep the PDA hooked up to power wherever I go, like somebody on life support. It came with GPS, but Tomtom Navigator still doesn't support it so I can't use it. Took it on holiday and found that the charger was intolerant of voltage fluctuation (20v variation) and would not charge, leaving me without a phone for 2 weeks in a foreign country. When taking a call, the whole PDA goes blank, so I cannot check diary or note down a number. The Speed Dial index is in such small fonts that hitting the right one is by trial and error.
